# Conclusion & Clean Up

We have now reached the end of this workshop. I truly hope that you have learned something. Your feedback is important, so please donâ€™t hesitate to send me a message if you hit any issue or ave any questions or comments. You can reached me at benoit.boure@gmail.com

I encourage you to keep practicing and experimenting with AWS AppSync. There is a lot more you can do. You can use this project as a starting point if you want.

To clean up everything we just did, you can run the following command.

```bash
npx sls remove
```

# Conclusion & Clean Up

We have now reached the end of this workshop. I truly hope that you have learned something. Your feedback is important, so please don't hesitate to send me a message if you hit any issue or ave any questions or comments. You can reached me at benoit@appsync.wtf

I encourage you to keep practicing and experimenting with AWS AppSync. There is a lot more you can do. You can use this project as a starting point if you want.

Before cleaning everything up, have a look at the final solution and make sure you understand everything. You can also find the [solution on Github](https://github.com/bboure/appsync-typescript-workshop/tree/solution). 

To clean up everything we just did, you can run the following command.

```bash
npx sls remove
```

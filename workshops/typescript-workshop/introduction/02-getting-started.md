# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

To follow this workshop, you will need:

- [an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start/email)
- basic understanding of GraphQL and the Schema Definitions Language (SDL)
- basic knowledge about AWS and its services (i.e. DynamoDB, Cognito)
- some background with TypeScript

## Will it cost me anything?

This workshop involves deploying several resources into your own AWS account. While most of those services have a generous free tier, and are inexpensive after that, you might incur some charges.

When this workshop is finished, we will also learn how to clean up and remove all the created resources to suppress any possible charges.

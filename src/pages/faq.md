# Frequently Asked Questions

### I wrote a blog post about AWS AppSync, can I add a link to it here?

Maybe. While we're thrilled about contributions, our primary aim is to curate a collection that delivers substantial value to our community. We prioritize resources that are relevant, useful and educational.

Examples of good content are: detailed tutorials, workshops, open source libraries, developer tools, etc.

Avoid: Posts that offer basic/generic information, outdated or repetitive content, etc.

### Can I write a guide/course/workshop directly into this website?

Yes! On the long run, we'd like to keep all the content accessible and centralized.
There are plans to include guides and cookbooks directly in this website.

At the time of writing this, there are not any contributor guidelines on how to do this yet. If you would like to collaborate, [hit me up](mailto:benoit.boure@gmail.com?subject=Collaborate%20to%20AppSync%20WTF).

### What does WTF stand for?
